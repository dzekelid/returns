      summary: Returns a list of the text types available in SAP Translation Hub.
      description: In SAP products, short texts, such as those used on user interfaces
        (UIs), are characterized by various text types. The type of a specific text
        is determined by the UI element that it describes. For example,  button texts
        are described by the text type ```XBUT```. <br> The text type resource returns
        a list of the text types that are available in SAP Translation Hub. You can
        combine the '/text type' resource with the '/suggestion' resource to narrow
        down the results of the suggestion resource.
