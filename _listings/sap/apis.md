    (UIs), are characterized by various text types. The type of a specific text is
    determined by the UI element that it describes. For example,  button texts are
    described by the text type ```XBUT```. <br> The text type resource returns a list
    of the text types that are available in SAP Translation Hub. You can combine the
    '/text type' resource with the '/suggestion' resource to narrow down the results
    of the suggestion resource.
