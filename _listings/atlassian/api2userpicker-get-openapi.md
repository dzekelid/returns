    get:
      summary: Get issue
      description: |-
        Returns a full representation of the issue for the given issue key.

        The issue JSON consists of the issue key and a collection of fields. Additional information like links to workflow transition sub-resources, or HTML rendered values of the fields supporting HTML rendering can be retrieved with `expand` request parameter specified.

        The `fields` request parameter accepts a comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. It can be used to retrieve a subset of fields. By default all fields are returned in the response. A particular field can be excluded from the response if prefixed with a "-" (minus) sign. Parameter can be provided multiple times on a single request.

        By default, all fields are returned in the response. Note: this is different from a JQL search - only navigable fields are returned by default (`*navigable`).

        Returns a [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) in order by display name.

        ### About notification schemes

        A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

        *   `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
        *   `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:

        *   `CurrentAssignee`
        *   `Reporter`
        *   `CurrentUser`
        *   `ProjectLead`
        *   `ComponentLead`
        *   `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
        *   `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
        *   `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
        *   `EmailAddress`
        *   `AllWatchers`
        *   `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
        *   `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

        _Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses._

        **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the requesting user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.

        ### About permission schemes and grants

        A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

        #### Holder

        The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the _Administer projects_ permission is granted to a group named _Teams in space administrators_. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

        *   `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
        *   `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

        The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

        *   `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
        *   `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Manage application access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-application-access-744721629.html) for more information.
        *   `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
        *   `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
        *   `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
        *   `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
        *   `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
        *   `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
        *   `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
        *   `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID).
        *   `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).

        #### Permissions

        The [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.
