      summary: Cities
      description: Returns Meetup cities. This method supports search by latitude/longitude/radius,

        searches by lat and lon return all cities within a radius of the provided
        coordinates. Searches with a query return up to 10 cities matching the term,
        and can be sorted by size or distance to a given coordinate. 'smart' ordering
        can be used to return the match(es) with the highest member_count, unless

        supported for country but not country and state
