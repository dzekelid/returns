description: AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs
  of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. These IT services can include everything
  from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier
  application architectures. AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage commonly
  deployed IT services, and helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your
  compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved
  IT services they need.
